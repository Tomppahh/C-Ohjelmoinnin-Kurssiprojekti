C-Ohjelmoinnin-Kurssiprojekti
C - programming course project with my group of three students. The project focused on building different data structure types and algorithms that could find names from large sets of text data and give desired search output to user. I focused on writing tests alot, but I also wrote the Djikstra algorithm and for example Breath - first and Depth - first search algorithms. Document wise I wrote the weekly test reports and final test report, but they arent avaiable in this repo.

# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive C programming course assignment, developed collaboratively by a team of three students. The main objective was to implement and test a variety of fundamental data structures and algorithms, with a focus on efficient searching and processing of large text-based name datasets.

## Features

- Efficient search and retrieval of names from large text files
- Command-line interface for user interaction
- Modular code structure for easy testing and extension
- Comprehensive test suite for all major components

## Data Structures Implemented

- Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree (self-balancing binary search tree)
- Red-Black Tree
- Graph (adjacency list representation)
- Name list management

## Algorithms Implemented

- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Sorting algorithms for name lists
- Tree balancing and traversal algorithms

## File Structure

- `main.c` – Program entry point and user interface
- `linkedlist.c/h` – Linked list implementation
- `binarytree.c/h` – Binary search tree implementation
- `avl_tree.c/h` – AVL tree implementation
- `rb_tree.c/h` – Red-black tree implementation
- `graph.c/h` – Graph and search algorithms
- `namelist.c/h` – Name list and file handling
- `test_*` – Test programs for various modules
- `common.c/h` – Shared utilities and helpers

## Usage

1. Build the project using the provided `Makefile`:
   ```sh
   make
   ```
2. Run the main program or test binaries as needed:
   ```sh
   ./main
   ./test_sorting
   ./binary_tree_tests
   ./graph_tests
   ```

## Notes

- Test reports and documentation were written during the course but are not included in this repository.
- The project demonstrates practical use of C for data structure and algorithm implementation, as well as systematic testing practices.
