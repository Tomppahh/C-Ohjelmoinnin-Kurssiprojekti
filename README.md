# C-Ohjelmoinnin-Kurssiprojekti
C - programming course project with my group of three students. The project focused on building different data structure types and algorithms that could find names from large sets of text data and give desired search output to user. 
I focused on writing tests alot, but I also wrote the Djikstra algorithm and for example Breath - first and Depth - first search algorithms. Document wise I wrote the weekly test reports and final test report, but they arent avaiable in this repo.
